This repository contains my ZSH configuration setup, including the installation of Zsh, Oh-My-Zsh, and additional customizations.

## Installation

### 1. Install Zsh using pacman:

```shell
pacman -S zsh
```

### 2. Set Zsh as your default shell:

```shell
chsh -s zsh
#or 
chsh -s  /usr/bin/zsh
```

### 3. Install Oh-My-Zsh:

To install Oh-My-Zsh, you can use the following one-liner command:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Oh-My-Zsh is a powerful tool for managing Zsh configurations.

### 4. Install zsh-antidote:

Before setting up my Zsh configuration, make sure you have the `zsh-antidote` package installed. You can install it using a package manager like `yay`:

```shell
yay -S zsh-antidote
```

### 5. Symbolic links:

To use my Zsh configuration, create the following symbolic links:

```shell
ln -s ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.config/zsh/.zsh_plugins.zsh ~/.zsh_plugins.zsh
ln -s ~/.config/zsh/.zsh_plugins.txt ~/.zsh_plugins.txt
```

These symbolic links will link the configuration files in this repository to their appropriate locations in your home directory.
